This is my repository from my time at Acembee

The codes and encoder files are files that I've made a very few modifications on with most of it
being bit-shifting. The samlet_funk is my IR-reciever and decoder for heatpump signals. The testdone is
the first code for my project where it can check if wired connections have been put together correctly. 

Please do enjoy!
